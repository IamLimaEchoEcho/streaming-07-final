Send/receive transactional file and send alerts on low balance or overdraw. 
#
    This emitter program will take a fictional transactional file (Transactions.csv) and read them at a rate of 1 per 1 second. 
     It will send a message that will contain the date, account number, and transaction amount.  
    The listener program will receive those transactions, test them against a current balance file (Current_Balance.csv) to alert low balance or overdrawn.
